The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.</p><p>At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",

You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.</p>\n<h3>Spell Slots</h3>\n<p>The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p>\n<h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Level</td>\n<td>Cantrips Known</td>\n<td>Spells Known</td>\n<td>Spell Slots</td>\n<td>Slot Level</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

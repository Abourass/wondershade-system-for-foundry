The DM has the Statistics for these creatures and resolves their Actions and Movement.</p><p>A creature remains in its giant size for the Duration, until it drops to 0 Hit Points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.</p><p>The DM might allow you to choose different Targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same Statistics as a Giant Wasp.</p>",

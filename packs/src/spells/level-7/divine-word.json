Each creature that can hear you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>50 Hit Points or fewer: Deafened for 1 minute</li>\n<li>40 Hit Points or fewer: Deafened and Blinded for 10 minutes</li>\n<li>30 Hit Points or fewer: Blinded, Deafened, and Stunned for 1 Hour</li>\n<li>20 Hit Points or fewer: killed instantly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regardless of its current Hit Points, a Celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend that fails its save is forced back to its plane of Origin (if it isn&rsquo;t there already) and can&rsquo;t return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a wish spell.</p>",

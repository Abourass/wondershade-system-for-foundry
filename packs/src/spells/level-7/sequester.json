When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes Invisible and can't be targeted by divination spells or perceived through Scrying sensors created by Divination Spells.</p><p>If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn't grow older.</p><p>You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include \"after 1,000 years\" or \"when the Tarrasque awakens.\" This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.</p>",

A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Ingested. </strong>A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.</p>\n<p><strong>Inhaled.</strong> These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.</p>\n<p><strong>Injury. </strong>Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><caption>\n<h4>Poisons</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Item</td>\n<td>Type</td>\n<td>Price per Dose</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Assassin's blood</td>\n<td>Ingested</td>\n<td>150 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Burnt othur fumes</td>\n<td>Inhaled</td>\n<td>500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Crawler mucus</td>\n<td>Contact</td>\n<td>200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Drow poison</td>\n<td>Injury</td>\n<td>200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Essence of ether</td>\n<td>Inhaled</td>\n<td>300 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Malice</td>\n<td>Inhaled</td>\n<td>250 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Midnight tears</td>\n<td>Ingested</td>\n<td>1,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oil of taggit</td>\n<td>Contact</td>\n<td>400 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pale tincture</td>\n<td>Ingested</td>\n<td>250 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Purple worm poison</td>\n<td>Injury</td>\n<td>2,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Serpent venom</td>\n<td>Injury</td>\n<td>200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Torpor</td>\n<td>Ingested</td>\n<td>600 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Truth serum</td>\n<td>Ingested</td>\n<td>150 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wyvern poison</td>\n<td>Injury</td>\n<td>1,200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Sample Poisons</h2>\n<p>Each type of poison has its own debilitating effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Assassin's Blood (Ingested). </strong>A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw.

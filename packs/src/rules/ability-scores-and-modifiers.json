An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.</p>\n<p>A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.</p>\n<p>Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from −5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><caption>\n<h4>Ability Scores and Modifiers</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Score</td>\n<td>Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>−5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2–3</td>\n<td>−4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4–5</td>\n<td>−3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6–7</td>\n<td>−2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8–9</td>\n<td>−1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10–11</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12–13</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14–15</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16–17</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18–19</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20–21</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22–23</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>24–25</td>\n<td>+7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>26–27</td>\n<td>+8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>28–29</td>\n<td>+9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).</p>\n<p>Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.</p>"

The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they&rsquo;re moving over.</p>\n<h2>Speed</h2>\n<p>Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a lifethreatening situation.</p>\n<p>The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>\n<h3>Travel Pace</h3>\n<p>While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.</p>\n<p><strong>Forced March. </strong>The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.</p>\n<p>For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.apBZudO4UA1wj7aC]{Exhaustion}.</p>\n<p><strong>Mounts and Vehicles. </strong>For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.</p>\n<p>Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don&rsquo;t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.</p>\n<p>Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a @Compendium[dnd5e.items.TjWk2mpNXjDdfIDM]{Carpet of Flying}, allow you to travel more swiftly.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><caption>\n<h4>Travel Pace</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Pace</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Distance Traveled per . . .</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Minute</td>\n<td>Hour</td>\n<td>Day</td>\n<td>Effect</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Fast</td>\n<td>400 feet</td>\n<td>4 miles</td>\n<td>30 miles</td>\n<td>- 5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>300 feet</td>\n<td>3 miles</td>\n<td>24 miles</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slow</td>\n<td>200 feet</td>\n<td>2 miles</td>\n<td>18 miles</td>\n<td>Able to use stealth</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Difficult Terrain</h3>\n<p>The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground&mdash;all considered difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>You move at half speed in difficult terrain&mdash; moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed&mdash;so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>\n<h2>Special Types of Movement</h2>\n<p>Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.</p>\n<h3>Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling</h3>\n<p>While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM&rsquo;s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.</p>\n<h3>Jumping</h3>\n<p>Your Strength determines how far you can jump.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Jump. </strong>When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.</p>\n<p>This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn&rsquo;t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM&rsquo;s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump&rsquo;s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.</p>\n<p>When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.</p>\n<p><strong>High Jump. </strong>When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.</p>\n<p>You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1&frac12; times your height.</p>"

Underwater the following rules apply.</p>\n<p>When making a <strong>melee weapon attack</strong>, a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.</p>\n<p>A <strong>ranged weapon attack</strong> automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).</p>\n<p>Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.</p>"

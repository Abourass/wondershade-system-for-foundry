      "value": "<p><em>(Requires attunement outdoors at night)</em></p>\n<p>While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.CAxSzHWizrafT033]{Dancing Lights} and @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Bnn9Nzajixvow9xi]{Light} from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the ring requires an action.</p>\n<p>The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>\n<p><strong>Faerie Fire</strong>. You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.nqBDWkVOfcGZt4YU]{Faerie Fire} from the ring.</p>\n<p><strong>Ball Lightning</strong>. You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.</p>\n<p>Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.</p>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Spheres</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Lightning Damage</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>4d12</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Shooting Stars</strong>. You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>",

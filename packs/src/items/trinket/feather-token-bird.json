The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d100</th>\n<th>Feather Token</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>01-20</td>\n<td>Anchor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21-35</td>\n<td>Bird</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>36-50</td>\n<td>Fan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>51-65</td>\n<td>Swan boat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>66-90</td>\n<td>Tree</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>91-00</td>\n<td>Whip</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Bird.</strong> You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a @Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.p980augbCIdpK9ZX]{Roc}, but it obeys your simple commands and can't attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.</p>\n<p><em>Foundry note: the 144 charges represent the 144 miles the bird can travel when being able to travel at maximum speed to enable accurate distance-tracking as required.</em></p>",

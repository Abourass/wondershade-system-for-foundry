At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an @Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.LTomFUTBrkRi0Pj5]{Efreeti} appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.</p>\n<p>The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>d100</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Effect</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01-10</td>\n<td>The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11-90</td>\n<td>The efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>91-00</td>\n<td>The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

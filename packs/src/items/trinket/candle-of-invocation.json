After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.</p>\n<p>While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st- level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.XbwGq5kDJNvAxNXV]{Gate}</em>spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.</p>",

If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends.

A {creature} can have only one creature swallowed at a time.</p><p>If the {creature} takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the {creature} must succeed on a  <strong>DC 14 Constitution</strong> saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 ft. of the {creature}. If the {creature} dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 ft. of movement, exiting prone.</p>\n</section>\n<p>The {creature} attacks with its Swallow.</p>",

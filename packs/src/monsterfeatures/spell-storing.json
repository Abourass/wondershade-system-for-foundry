The spell has no effect but is stored within the {creature}. When commanded to do so by the wearer or when a situation arises that was predefined by the spellcaster, the {creature} casts the stored spell with any parameters set by the original caster, requiring no components. When the spell is cast or a new spell is stored, any previously stored spell is lost.</p>",

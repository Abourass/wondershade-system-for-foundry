It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the {creature}, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.</p><p>A target that successfully saves is immune to this {creature}'s song for the next 24 hours.</p>\n</section>\n<p>The {creature} sings a magical melody.
